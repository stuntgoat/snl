Sample N number of Lines from a file.

I thought there would be fun to write a BASH script to return random lines from a file. Turns out that people have already written one-liners to return one line from a file as written here:

Once I started looking at their solutions it became clear it would be about as fun to write a program in C that would do what I wanted; but that feeling didn't last because I wanted more instant gratification. So this is my attempt at a Go implementation.
